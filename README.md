# SharpboyPlusPlus 
### A Gameboy (DMG) emulator in C++ with SDL and ImGui
This is my first attempt at a major project in C++, trying to learn as much as possible whilst working on it. It's currently a w.i.p loading boot rom and some games with 32Kb ROM sizes and no gui. Currently passing all of mooneye's test roms for timing, cpu instructions, interrupts and OAM DMA.
